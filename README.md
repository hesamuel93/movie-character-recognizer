# Movie Character Recognizer
Upload images of a specific movie/TV/comic character that your are a fan of, or even images of original characters that you created/designed yourself.
Then, if you have more images of characters, and you want to group them together into one collection, you can do so using this tool.

## How It's Made
The tool mainly uses the CLIP model from OpenAI, as well as cosine similarity tests, to analyze the images and recognize the characters. The app can be run on the web, with a backend built on Python and a frontend built on Javascript and HTML.

## Usage
Once you clone/download this project, you can use it by first executing the *python "app.py"* command.
Then, open the html file or go to *http://127.0.0.1:5000* in your browser to run the web app.
